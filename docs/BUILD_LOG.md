## Step 0.1: Repo, environment, app skeleton (2026-10-28)

**What changed**
- `git init` in `paypal/` (branch `main`). `.gitignore` keeps out the virtualenv, caches, `*.db` files and `.env`.
- `backend/.venv`: a private Python 3.11 environment for this project only.
- `backend/pyproject.toml`: every library pinned to an exact version (`==`), plus pytest settings.
- `backend/app/config.py`: one `Settings` class that reads environment variables or `backend/.env`.
- `backend/app/main.py`: `create_app()` builds the FastAPI app with a `GET /health` endpoint.
- `backend/tests/api/test_health.py`: first test.

**Why it's built this way**
- *Virtualenv:* the project's libraries don't collide with other projects on your machine, and a judge can recreate the exact setup.
- *Exact pins:* the old project's `requirements.txt` used `>=` and was missing two libraries (issue M8). With `==`, everyone installs the same versions and nothing upgrades under you mid-hackathon.
- *Settings in one place:* code never reads `os.environ` directly. Every key, model name and flag lives in `Settings`, so tests can override them and nothing is hard-coded. An empty model name means "not configured", which later makes a check return UNVERIFIABLE instead of guessing.
- *App factory (`create_app`)*: tests build a fresh app each time instead of sharing one global, which keeps tests independent.

**Key idea: FastAPI request flow**
`uvicorn` is the web server. It receives the HTTP request, hands it to the FastAPI `app`, FastAPI matches the path (`/health`) to a Python function, calls it, and turns the returned dict into JSON. FastAPI also generates the interactive docs at `/docs` (Swagger UI) from the same functions; that's how you'll test the API without a frontend.

**How to see it**
```bash
cd backend
.venv/Scripts/python -m pytest -q
.venv/Scripts/python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
Then open http://localhost:8000/health and http://localhost:8000/docs.

**Verified:** `pytest` → 1 passed; `/health` → `{"status":"ok","env":"development"}`; `/docs` → 200.
